# Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

- Designed and implemented a deep learning-based object detection
model using TensorFlow and OpenCV
- Trained the model on a dataset of 50,000 images and achieved an
accuracy of 96%
- Worked with a team of 3 engineers to deploy the model on a cloud-based
platform for autonomous vehicle testing
- Published a research paper on the project in a reputable journal on
autonomous vehicles
