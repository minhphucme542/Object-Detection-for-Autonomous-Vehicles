# Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

- Designed and implemented a deep learning-based object detection
model using TensorFlow and OpenCV
- Trained the model on a dataset of 50,000 images and achieved an
accuracy of 96%
- Worked with a team of 3 engineers to deploy the model on a cloud-based
platform for autonomous vehicle testing
- YOLO model achieved a mAP of 0.85 on our test dataset, the real-time
object detection system was able to detect objects in real-time with a
frame rate of 30 FPS
